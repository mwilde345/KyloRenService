## Setup
* download raspbian. flash an SD using balenaEtcher (just follow raspbian guide......)
* mvpdev is password for pi
* /boot/config.txt >> display_rotate=1 (90 deg rotate)
* sudo service lightdm restart (reboot just the gui)
* ctrl+alt+f1 to term, ctrl+alt+f7 back to gui

* neopixels on pi: https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi
* need 74AHCT125 or 74HCT125N converters and mini breadboard
* wiring with the level shifting chip: https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-wiring
* got afp on pi. now on mac do open afp:raspberrypi.local to mount remote fs
* startup script: https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/8734/execute-script-on-start-up
 * went with the superscript option
 * use shelljs: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44647778/how-to-run-shell-script-file-using-nodejs
 * that way we can run the script to do npm link iff package.json was updated which we can check for in conditional-install script.
